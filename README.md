# Discord Econ Bot
Hobby side project to explore the limitations of the discordjs library and get into basic databasing and caching mechanisms. Also for fun times as it's been well received

# TODO
finish fleshing out bot features, once this is done I can clean up the code considerably and look into if other databasing paradimes besides json might be necessary. I want to eventually functionize the code way more making it much safer and more readable, but this isnt in my plans until I have a complete view of every feature and their interactions.
